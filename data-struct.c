// Note for Chapter 2

/*
 * Stack:
 * - LIFO (Last in first out)
 *     - just like a deck??
 * - Has 2 simple operations get and put or pop and push
 */

/*
 * Queue:
 * - FIFO (First In, First Out)
 *     - like a line at a restaurant first person to join the line gets
 *     served first
 *  - Two operations Enqueue, and Dequeue, insert item x at the back of queue
 *  and return the front item from queue
 *  - Littler harder to implement compared to stakcs
 *
 */

// Depending on whether the size is known prior, array or linked list will
// have to be used

/*
 * Dictionary (Set??):
 * - access to data items by content
 *   Primary Operations:
 *   - Search (D, k) - D: dict, k: key, return content of key k
 *   - Insert (D, x) - Given data x, add it to set in D
 *   - Delete (D, x) - Given a pointer to x, remove it from D
 *   - Max(D), Min(D) - return min or max of dictionary
 *
 * - The cost of each of the operations depend on whether the dictionary
 * is ordered or unordered.
